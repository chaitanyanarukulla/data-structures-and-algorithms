 ##  FizzBuzzTree
  ### FizzBuzzTree class
  <!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
Return the tree with its new values.   
 ## Approach & Efficiency
 <!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 
 Time O(n)
 Space O(1)
 
 
## API
1. If the tree node value is divisible by 3 then change the value to "Fizz"

2. If the tree node value is divisible by 5 then change the value to "Buzz"

3. If the tree node value is divisible by 3 and 5 then change the value to "FizzBuzz"

1. If the tree node value is not divisible by 3 or 5 then leave the data of the tree node as is
