 ## ArrayShift
  ###ArrayShift.class
  <!-- Description of the challenge -->
   Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.  
  ### Approach & Efficiency
  <!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
  I Approached this problem by creating a new array , finding the mid point of old arry and running a for loop on old arry to insert the values of old arry into new array  untill mid point  , insert the new value at midpoint  and start the for loop again from the midpoint after the new value inserted and insert rest of the values from old array ,
