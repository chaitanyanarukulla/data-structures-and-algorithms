# Tree Intersection
- Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Space: O(n)
- Time: O(n)

## API and Acknowledgements
- tree_intersection(BinaryTree<Integer> treeOne, BinaryTree<Integer> treeTwo)
- Will Fritts and Luke Chandler for all of the help with debugging the testing and the method
