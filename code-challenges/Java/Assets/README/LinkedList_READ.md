## LinkedList
  ###LinkedList.class
  <!-- Description of the challenge -->
  Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
  Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  ### Approach & Efficiency
  <!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
  
 
  A linear algorithm â€“ O(n) Runtime grows directly in proportion to n
