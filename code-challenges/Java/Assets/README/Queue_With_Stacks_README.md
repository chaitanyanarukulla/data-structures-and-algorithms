## Queue With Stacks
### PseudoQueue.class
  <!-- Description of the challenge -->

PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface, but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:
enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

  ###Approach & Efficiency  

 
 Time space complexity is  O(n^2).
