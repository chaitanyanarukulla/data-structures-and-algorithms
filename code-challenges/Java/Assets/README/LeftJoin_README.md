# Left Join
- Find and return the first repeated word in a lengthy string

 ## Challenge
- Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
- The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
- The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic
 ## Approach & Efficiency
- Space: O(2n) which is O(n)
- Time: O(1)
