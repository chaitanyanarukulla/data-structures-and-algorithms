 ##  Binary Search
  ###BinarySearchTree.class
  <!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
  ###Approach & Efficiency  
 
 
 Time space complexity is of O(n).
